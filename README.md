# Out-of-Order Pipeline Simulator

This is a simulator for a superscaler Out-of-Order(OOO) Pipeline I developed for my Microprocessor Architecture(ECE 563) course at North Carolina State University. This simulator may not cover an OOO pipeline that is commercially made 1-to-1 but it covers the main aspects of an OOO pipeline, in that it assumes perfect branch predictions and expections occur for the pipeline to mitigate. For this program, it reads a trace file that has each pc number, instruction type, destination register number, source register one and source register two number for each line of the trace. The simulator allows for the user to configure the size of the Reorder Buffer(ROB), Issue Queue(IQ), and function unit. The simulator measures the number of cycles it takes to complete the instructions from the trace as well as the IPC, which gave me the opportunity to perform a deeper analyses of IPC between different sizes across different sized configurations, which I will attach below.
